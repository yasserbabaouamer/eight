## 4. Reflection

Eight was developed as the final project for the Web Development module during my second year of university. The primary objectives of the project were to:

- **Showcase the restaurant's information, including its description and identity.**
- **Provide users with the ability to view the restaurantâ€™s menu.**
- **Enable users to make table reservations.**
- **Implement the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.**

## Challenges Faced

### Implementing the Table Reservation Logic

I needed to create a query that checks table availability based on various factors, including date, time, size, and duration. Additionally, I implemented functionality to suggest alternative times to offer more options for customers.

### Managing Customer Reviews

To ensure that each customer only displayed their most recent review, I wrote a query that retrieves the latest review per customer in the reviews section, giving visitors insight into the most recent customer impressions.

### Developing the Backend with PHP

This was my first experience with PHP for backend development, requiring me to learn the PHP syntax and how to structure backend applications effectively.

## 5. Project Status
